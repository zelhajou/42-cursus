1. **Sequence**: Sequence is the simplest programming concept. It refers to executing instructions in a sequential order, one after another. Each statement is executed in the order it appears in the code.
    
2. **Selection ([[Conditional Statements]])**: Selection allows you to make decisions in your code. Conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `else if`, `else`) enable you to execute different code blocks based on whether certain conditions are met. This is fundamental for branching your code.
    
3. **Repetition ([[Loops]])**: Loops are used to repeat a specific block of code multiple times. Common loop structures include `for`, `while`, and `do-while`. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks.
    
4. **Functions/Methods**: Functions (or methods, depending on the programming language) are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They promote code modularity and reusability, allowing you to call the same code with different inputs.

These basic techniques are the fundamental building blocks for writing programs. By combining them, you can create more complex logic and solve a wide range of problems in programming. For example, you might use sequences to set up initial variables, conditional statements to make decisions, and loops to iterate over data or perform repetitive tasks. Functions/methods help you encapsulate and reuse code, making your programs more organized and efficient. These techniques are used in almost every programming language and form the basis for more advanced programming concepts.
