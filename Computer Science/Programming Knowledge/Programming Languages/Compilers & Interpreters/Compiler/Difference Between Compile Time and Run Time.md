# **What is Compile Time?**

**Compile-time is the period when the programming code is converted to the machine code.**

Compiler converts the High-level language into low-level language. If there are any errors in the high-level language, the compiler shows a compilation error.

### Compile-time errors

These are the errors that occur at the time of compilation. There are mainly two types of Compile-time errors.

- Semantic errors.
- Syntax errors.

### Semantic errors

The code having absurd meaning refers to semantic errors. In other words, meaningless statements are termed semantic errors.

**Syntax errors**

Syntax refers to the rules that define the structure of a language. The syntax error is an incorrect construction of the source code.


# **What is Run Time?**

**Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.**

**Run-time errors**

These are the errors that occur during the execution of the program. The compiler does not detect the Runtime errors. One of the few basic runtime exceptions is "Array Index Out of Bound.‚Äù


**Difference Between Compile Time Errors vs Runtime Errors**

|Compile-time error|Run-time error|
|---|---|
|These errors are detected during the compile-time|These errors are detected at the run-time|
|Compile-time errors do not let the program be compiled|Programs with run-time errors are compiled successfully, but an error is encountered when the program is executed|
|Compile-time errors can occur because of wrong syntax or meaningless statements|Run-time errors occur because of absurd operations|
