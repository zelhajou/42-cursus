Any computer system to be useful, it needs a **storage - storage for data**. A computer needs **primary storage** for any data. that it needs access quickly. this includes the start-up instructions the operating system, **Program** that are running and any associated data.

There are tow main types of **Primary storage : RAM - ROM**

**Program** : is a set of functions to perform a task

**Function** A subprogram that returns a value to the main program

- is a closed entity that has :
    - Input date : the parameters.
    - A piece of output data : the return value.
- **Parameters** Values that a main program sends to subprograms for them to use.

# **RAM :**

Ram is a part of the main memory in a computer system.

When a program is loaded, it is copied from **secondary storage**, Such as a hard-disk. Any data is associated with the program will also be stored in **RAM** so that the **CPU** can access both the data and instructions

# **The units of a data storage :**

**Computer uses electronic circuits etched onto computer chips to store data and instructions.**

these circuits electronic switches made from tiny transistors Each switch can be in one of two states: ON or OFF.

The two states are represented by the number 1 or 0. A computer uses combinations of these 1s and 0s to represent data and instructions.

There i a number system that only uses the two values 1 and 0. it is called the **binary number system** and it is used to describe the on/off status of all the switches in a computer.

**1** binary digit is called a **bit,** computer often group **8 bits** together as one unit of data .

These 8 bits together are called a byte.
