Abstraction in <ins>computer science</ins> refers to the process of simplifying more manageable and easier to understand it involves hiding unnecessary details while retaining the essential characteristics of a system or object.

In <ins>programming</ins>, abstraction is used to create abstract data types or classes that provide a high-level interface for users to interact  with, while hiding the implementation details. this allows developers to focus on the functionality of the code without getting bogged down in the details of how it works.

Abstraction is also used in <ins>computer architecture</ins> and operating systems to provide a layer of separation between hardware and software. this allows programs to run on different types of hardware without needing to be rewritten for each platform.

```
In general, abstraction is a powerful tooling computer science that allows developers to create more modular, maintainable, and reusable software systems. it helps to simplify complexity and make systems easier to understand and use.

# Implementing abstraction : 

In general, abstraction is implemented by what is generically termed an <ins>Application Programming interface (API)</ins>
API is a somewhat nebulous term that means different things in the context of various programming endeavors. fundamentally, a programmer designs a set of functions and documents their interface and functionality with the principle that the actual implementation providing the APU is opaque.

**For example**, many large web application provide an API accessible via HTTP. Accessing data via this method surely triggers many complicated series of remote procedure calls, database queries and data transfers, all of which are opaque to the end user who simply receives the contracted data.

Those familiar whit object-oriented languages such as java, python or C++ would be familiar with the abstraction provided by classes. Methods the interface to the class, but abstract the implementation.
