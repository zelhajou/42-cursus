# **Deployment**

## **Concepts to Learn**

- **Load Balancing:** The process of distributing workloads across multiple servers, where the main purpose of load balancing is to prevent any single server from getting overloaded. You can’t build scalable applications without applying load balancers.
- **GitHub Actions:** They enable you to create [custom software development](https://asahitechnologies.com/custom-software-development/) cycle workflows in your GitHub repository, and these workflows are made out of different tasks knows as actions that can be run automatically on certain events.
- **SSH:** Stands for _**Secure Socket Shell,**_ a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network, SSH provides a strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network.
- **Monitoring:** A web application that handles a lot of user interaction always requires monitoring to make sure that the application is performing at its peaks. One of the main goals of monitoring is to achieve high availability by minimizing time to detect & the time to mitigate.
- **SSL Certificates:** They enable websites to move from **HTTP** to **more secure HTTPS**. The SSL certificate is a data file hosted in a website’s origin server and they contain website public key along with other related information.

## **Serverless (FaaS)**

The concept of serverless computing via serverless architecture, developers use this to deploy an individual function or a piece of logic which they want to start within milliseconds and process individual requests. One of the best options for computing services are listed below:

- **AWS Lambda**
- **Netlify**

## **Virtualization**

Using Virtualization you can create powerful IT services that require traditional connections to hardware, which allows you to use a physical machine at its full capacity by distributing its capability to many users.

You can use **Kubernetes** and **Docker**, the basic difference between these are is that Kubernetes run across _**clusters**_ while Docker runs on a _**single node**_. Most of the developers prefer using both of them together to build better infrastructure.

A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. ... Kubernetes clusters allow containers to run across multiple machines and environments: virtual, physical, cloud-based, and on-premises.
